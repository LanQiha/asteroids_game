# LIFAMI_projet

Projet de fin de semestre en LIFAMI.

Download the game here : https://github.com/LanQiha/LIFAMI_projet/releases (English Version)

I used the Grapic library (https://github.com/ucacaxm/grapic) and SDL_mixer library (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) to make the game.

Thanks to Layachi and MÃ©linda for testing the game before the official release.
